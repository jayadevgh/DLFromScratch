Highly configurable deep learning functionality is implemented  from scratch using Python's numpy package. There is no support for GPU and automatic differentiation. 
Though it is a simple deep learning implementation without any bells and whistles, a real world deep learning model is created for CA housing prices.
I will add more examples later. It is an excellent way to learn deep learning. 

I learned deep learning through the following resources. 

1. Grokking Deep learning: 
https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning
I learned bits and pieces of deep learning in this book. Author has clearly explained the concepts.

2. Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with python from first principles
https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Scratch-Building-Principles/dp/1492041416
This is an excellent book. This book not only helped me to learn deep learning but also to implement it and write a maintainable code. 

3. Inside deep learning
https://www.manning.com/books/inside-deep-learning
This book helped me to understand the DL research papers. Mathematical formulas are clearly explained in detail.

4. Hands-On Machine Learning 
https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646
My reference book for Machine learning.
